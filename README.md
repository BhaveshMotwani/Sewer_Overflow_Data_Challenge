# Sewer_Overflow_Data_Challenge

One month data open data challenge to win a summer informatics internship with ARGO!

## The Challenge

Create an epic visualization of Sanitary Sewer Outflows (SSO)!  The data is available in the SSO_Data folder in this repo and the [original files can be found at the following link](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/sso/docs/index.php).  

Note in particular that "The SSO Data tables above are all keyed on the sanitary system WDID number." 

Also note that the data fields are defined on that Glossary of Terms at the top of the page on the orignal file link above and [directly here](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/sso/glossary.shtml).

Please leave any questions about the datasets in the issues so they form a reausable resource for future participants!

## Questions to Explore

(1) where and how bad (volume, made it to receiving water, etc.) are the sewage leaks (SSOs)? 
(2) how are sewage leaks changing over time? 
(3) which agencies have the most (by occurence, by volume, etc.) sewage leaks? 
(4) what other data can be brought to bear on this topic (precip, storm water dry weather flows, etc.)?
(5) find other patterns and unique insights!

An [example operational report can be found here](https://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/readOnly/publicReportSSOPerformance.jsp?wdid=1SSO10001&startDate=&endDate=).

## Timeline

Please submit your final responses as a pull request to a fork of this repo by Friday May 26th at 5 PM PST.

## The Prize

The best submission will win a paid summer internship with ARGO on our big water data or other urban analytics projects.
